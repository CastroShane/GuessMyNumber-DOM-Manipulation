# GuessMyNumber-DOM-Manipulation
<h4> DISCLAIMER: I did not code this from scratch. This is an instructor-guided project when I was taking a Javascript course from Udemy. </h4>

<strong>Learning Objectives: </strong> Learn about DOM manipulation

<strong>Game mechanics: </strong>
<ul>
<li>Guess the unknown number between 1 and 20</li>
<li>Player has 20 chances to guess the number</li>
<li>Every wrong guess will be deducted to the score (chances)</li>
<li>Once the correct number has been identified, the remaining score can be placed as the highscore if it's higher than the previous game</li>
</ul>

<strong>HINTS:</strong>
<ul>
<p>The game will give you a hint every time you take a wrong guess. For example, supposed the unknown number is number 11 and you put 12, a message will prompt that your guess is too high. This should tell you that your next guess should be lower than the previous one.</p>
</ul>
